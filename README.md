Color analysis theory:Color analysis (American English; colour analysis in Commonwealth English), also known as personal color analysis (PCA), seasonal color analysis, or skin-tone matching, is a term often used within the cosmetics and fashion industry to describe a method of determining the colors of clothing and cosmetics that harmonize with the appearance of a person's skin complexion, eye color, and hair color for use in wardrobe planning and style consulting.
The internet has been buzzing about the Korean color analysis technique, which categorizes individuals into four distinct seasons: Summer, Winter, Autumn, and Spring. If you have warm tones, you fall within the realms of either Spring or Autumn, while cool-toned individuals are classified as Summer or Winter. People were fascinated by this method, which involved placing multiple colored sheets on the face to determine the most flattering tones. Many became intrigued and eager to know their "go-to" colors.
Inspired by this, I created a webpage that doesn't have an extravagant frontend but boasts a powerful backend. I have trained a model that identifies your go-to colors based on your unique features. This concept could be integrated into online shopping apps, offering personalized color recommendations to enhance the shopping experience and help customers find the most suitable products for their skin tone.
